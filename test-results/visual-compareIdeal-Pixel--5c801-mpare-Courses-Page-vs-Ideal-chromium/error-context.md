The best aspect of the course was the doubt-solving sessions, which not only resolved my doubts but also helped me understand what was wrong in my approach. I improved in many concepts thanks to the amazing live classes, and their contests provided valuable insights into my performance throughout the course.

After the course, my growth really took off. I gained over 200 positive deltas, moving from Newbie to Specialist in three months. The mentors are pretty cool and, apart from clearing doubts, they often reviewed my profile and provided guidance on how to reach Specialist. The overall experience there was great.

What I loved most about TLE was the massive amount of concepts I learned in a structured manner, which would have been extremely hard to learn on my own. The only thing I regret is not finding out about TLE earlier. If you want to get better at CP, joining TLE is a no-brainer.

Apart from the rating gain, I got clarity about the topics I needed to study, especially string hashing, binary search and graph problems, which would have been very hard to find otherwise. Tutorials are available everywhere but getting to know why my code is failing from the mentors is the most satisfying thing ever and that is the best thing about TLE. Anyone with a will to improve should go ahead with TLE Eliminators.

Through TLE’s Level 3 course, I learned many crucial topics, such as binary search, string hashing, and greedy approach, in a structured format, which led to better results. Within three months, I advanced from Newbie to Specialist rank.

By the end of the course, I became a 4-star on CodeChef and reached a rating of 1340 on Codeforces. The most important thing I learned from TLE was to keep learning on my own. I got familiar with CP and got to know about amazing resources. Fast forward to now, I have achieved a rating of 1584 (highest) on Codeforces and become a Guardian on LeetCode (2300+).
