          - paragraph [ref=e296]: In my CP journey, TLE has played a great role. Before TLE, I was stuck at Newbie for a long time despite being consistent. After the course, my growth really took off. I gained over 200 positive deltas, moving from Newbie to Specialist in three months. The mentors are pretty cool and, apart from clearing doubts, they often reviewed my profile and provided guidance on how to reach Specialist. The overall experience there was great.

          - paragraph [ref=e304]: I joined TLE as a newbie on Codeforces and became a Specialist during the course. One of the best aspects of TLE is the comprehensive knowledge it provides on every topic, including complex ones like dynamic programming (DP) and graphs. The doubt support is outstanding, with queries addressed within 5-10 minutes. The practice problems are both educational and challenging, significantly contributing to my progress. Additionally, they provide video solutions for all practice problems. The gamified scoring feature on the course website kept me motivated.

What I loved most about TLE was the massive amount of concepts I learned in a structured manner, which would have been extremely hard to learn on my own. The only thing I regret is not finding out about TLE earlier. If you want to get better at CP, joining TLE is a no-brainer.

Tutorials are available everywhere but getting to know why my code is failing from the mentors is the most satisfying thing ever and that is the best thing about TLE. Anyone with a will to improve should go ahead with TLE Eliminators.
